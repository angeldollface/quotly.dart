***Inspiring quotes for you! :eye: :joystick:***

## ABOUT :books:

I've been feeling down lately and as I was scrolling through some stupid social media app, I found a page that had some quotes. I found the quotes inspiring and they lifted my mood. I thought I'd write an app to do that because why the hell not? This is that app!
